# Introduction

Upon my graduation with a Bachelor Degree in _Civil Engineering_ in 2006, I subsequently got my Master Degree in 2009 in the University of Science and Technology Beijing (USTB), majoring _Engineering Mechanics_. In 2009, with interests in civil engineering, I further pursued my PhD study in the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and defended my thesis in 2014 with a title _2D and 3D Limit Analyses for Stability Problems in Geotechnical Engineering_.

I first joined Aurecon Hong Kong Ltd in 2012 as an assistant engineer and was involved on several practical engineering designs, most of which were designs of excavation and temporary works.  After two years working with Aurecon, I joined Ove Arup & Partners Hong Kong Ltd to experience a wider spectrum of design and supervision on various works.

In total, I have spent over 6 years in research in relation to civil engineering (2.5 years study for my Master Degree and 3.5 years study in PhD research) and have been working as a practicing engineer for approximately 8 years up to the date of this report. By documenting my work experience of selected projects in this report, I will demonstrate that I have achieved the attributes set out by HKIE for a competent civil engineer.

# Design and Supervision Experience

## Tender Designs of Temporary Works of a few Shatin to Central Link (SCL) Packages (08/2012 ~ 12/2012)

When I first entered the industry in late 2012, I started with some tender designs when several Shatin to Central Link (SCL) packages were put out to bid. As an assistant engineer, I worked with Contractors in providing designs for temporary works, mostly Excavation and Lateral Support (ELS) design. Specifically, my involvement in the tunnel packages (SCL1107 and SCL 1108) included reviewing and selecting design parameters provided in the geological reports, proposing or optimizing the retaining structures and shoring systems by performing various analysis, e.g,  I performed seepage analysis to determine the water drawdown and settlement assessment of the excavation, stability assessment of retaining structure during installation of each layer of struts, determination of the toe level of the retaining wall, etc.

Tender designs commonly come with a short design cycle and a tight timeframe; through this experience, I learned to quickly identify the key aspects that would be a major concern for ELS designs. Unfortunately, we did not win the contracts to follow up with a detailed design.


## Tai Po Water Treatment Plant – Temporary Work Design (12/2012 ~ 12/2013)

The expansion of the Tai Po Water Treatment Plant consisted of upgrading existing water treatment facilities and constructing additional components to increase the current capacity. New buildings and structures are shown **Figure \ref{f_taipo}**. The Water Supplies Department (WSD) awarded the construction contract to China-ATAL Joint Venture.

![Expansion of Tai Po Water Treatment Plant\label{f_taipo}](Image/tai_po_layout.jpg){width=500}

**Figure \ref{f_taipo}** shows the facilities that were proposed to be constructed in close proximity to the existing buildings and structures. Major concerns of the design were the impacts of the proposed construction on the existing building and structures. 

I was then engaged in a team to provide engineering services for all the temporary works and site formation works. Before the construction, a comprehensive condition survey was conducted to investigate and record the existing defects of the buildings/structures/geotechnical features, which served as the baseline for the establishment of an effective monitoring scheme and construction impact assessment.

Temporary works design included the design of retaining wall, open cut, excavation and support system, site formation etc. As the impacts on the existing building and structures are of great concern in the design, I also performed construction risk assessments which included integrity assessment of the neighbouring building affected by ground movement, substructure movement due to the excavation, global stability of the existing structures affected by unbalanced earth pressure and the impact on the geological features.


## Independent Checking Shatin Central Link (SCL) Contract 1103 (01/2013 ~ 08/2014)

SCL Contract 1103 is a tunnel section between Hin Keng and Diamond Hill, comprising two launching shafts, one 40m diameter ventilation shaft, one EAP shaft and 5.8km tunnel. The construction contract was awarded to Vinci Construction Grands Projects. I was working for Aurecon Hong Kong Ltd. to provide Independent Engineering Checking services to all the temporary works and alternative designs proposed by the Contractor. A master layout plan of the SCL 1103 works is shown in **Figure \ref{f_1103}**.

![Layout Plan of SCL 1103 \label{f_1103}](Image/SCL_1103_Layout.jpg){ width=500 }

I was the checking engineer and also the project coordinator of this project. We performed independent checking of temporary works for this project. I gained tremendous exposure to design of temporary works, ranging from the as large elements as diaphragm wall design at Diamond Hill to as small as foundation design of chain link fence. It is the duty of Independent Checking Engineer (ICE) to the exam and ensures that the contractor’s design of temporary work is based on valid information and assumptions.

Under the supervision of the senior engineers, I was responsible for checking civil packages including diaphragm wall and shoring design at Diamond Hill launching shaft, pipe pile wall at Hin Ken cut and cover tunnel, foundation design of crane tower, etc. Some of the major checking items are presented in **Appendix \ref{a_1103}**.

The checking works comprise a great number of design packages of geotechnical, structural, tunnel and electricity and mechanics elements. I managed and coordinated checking works collaborated by different teams and offices. As the project coordinator, I held meetings with the related teams to discuss the breakdowns of the tasks, the timeframe of the packages, available resources, and budget agreed with the client. A filing registering system was set up to keep records of the incoming and outgoing items, responsible engineers and the status of checking. When receiving comments from our team, I would scrutinize the comments to ensure that the comments make sense and discuss with the checking engineer if necessary. Sometimes, it is necessary to negotiate with the client and checking team on the budget and timeframe of the checking.

## Thoroughbred Training Centre (08/2014 ~ 04/2015)

This project is concerned with a development of 150 ha area with 5 million cubic metres of cut and fills works. Buildings and structures are in general low-rise. A plan of the proposed structure and building are shown in **Figure \ref{f_Thoroughbred}**.

I was primarily involved in the foundation design and checking for different types of structures. One of the biggest challenges of the project was that the site was relatively newly filled and the underlying fill was still undergoing creep settlement resulted from the relatively young fills. Great care is needed for dealing with the settling ground due to the concern of excessive differential settlement arising from the highly varying thickness of the fill (see **Figure \ref{f_Thoroughbred_geo}**). Different foundation systems had been employed for various buildings over the site, including footings, raft foundations and pile foundation.

![Master Plan for the Thoroughbred Training Centre\label{f_Thoroughbred}](Image/214379_additional monitoring-A0 - New fill.png){width=350}

The first thought for solving this problem was to model the raft foundation in full numerical model, where soil masses can be treated in a more sophisticated constitutive model rather than simple springs. This becomes numerically demanding as it proved troublesome to model the entire superstructure. Eventually, we calculated the spring stiffness required in the structural model would be provided by its definition, i.e., the load/Displacement $p/\delta$, where p is the load acting on the soil mass and $\delta$ is the soil response displacement. The creep settlement estimated was then superimposed to the elastic settlement, thereby reducing the stiffness of the underlying soils. As the two components of forces and displacement are inter-related, it gave rise to an iterative analysis between structure models and geotechnical settlement models. **Appendix \ref{a_Stable}** presents one of the slides in lunch talk I delivered introducing the concept.

## Hong Kong Boundary Crossing Facilities (04/2015 ~ 07/2018)

Hong Kong Boundary Crossing Facilities (HKBCF) serves an import transportation hub after completion. A non-dredged seawall construction method for was adopted by using stone columns and large-diameter steel cells along the seawall footprint working as a temporary supporting structure. In the reclamation area, prefabricated vertical drains and 6m additional surcharge were employed to treat underlying marine deposit prior to construction of the superstructures. A plan showing the location of the BCF relative to adjacent transportation links is shown in **Figure \ref{f_HKBCF}**.

![Location Plan of Hong Kong Boundary Crossing Facilities\label{f_HKBCF}](Image/HKBCF_Layout.png){width=500}

I have been having heavy involvement in this project since April 2015. In more than three years in this innovative and challenging project, I have gained extensive experience in technical, supervisory, managerial and contractual aspects. Some of my major roles will be highlighted in the following sections.

### Instrumentation and Back Analyses 

Instrumentation and monitoring function as crucial components in reclamation design as they form the basis upon which the decision of surcharging/removal or land handover can be made. Monitoring data obtained from various instruments reveals the spatial-temporal behaviour the soft marine sediments and seawalls in response to the reclamation and surcharging. Information of interests in reclamation works includes settlement, pore-water pressure, water table, lateral movements of seawalls and subsurface movement etc. Some photos of instruments are presented in **Appendix \ref{a_BCF_Instru}** and typical expected response from instruments are illustrated in **Appendix \ref{a_BCF_monitor}**.

I was responsible for undertaking predictive and inverse analyses based on monitoring data to verify the design assumptions, assess residual settlement, estimate the degree of consolidation, bridge the understanding between expectations and actual observations, and advise measures to be taken, if necessary. Inverse analyses are inherently difficult as observations are responses to various contributing factors and require holistic understanding and analyses of soil behaviour, construction history, concurrent activities and instrumentation. In some cases, it is found also necessary to instruct additional instruments and in-situ tests to obtain extra information and assist in making the judgment when conflicting information or apparently incorrect information was observed. One example of such situations we once encounter was that vibrating wire piezometers registered exceptionally high pore-water pressure at some localised area, indicating a low degree of consolidation. However, ground movement data did not show any slow ground settlement rate. We specified Casagrande piezometer at the same location to ascertain the readings and performed shear strength tests at the same time to check the strength gains of the surrounding soils. Samples were also taken to have a better perception of the ground condition. The supplementary results indicate the strength of MD has in general achieved expected sufficient strength gain and we then instructed the surcharge removal.

### Seawall Stability Assessment

I worked on reviews of the seawall stability based on observed behaviour of the seawalls. We proposed additional ground investigation (GI) to assess the actual shear strength of consolidated soils at various sections. GI works were mainly arranged in a line perpendicular to the seawall alignment. Such additional ground investigation comprises Cone Penetration Tests (CPTs), drillholes with Vane Shear Test (VSTs) and supplemented with Undrained-Unconsolidated (UU) and Consolidated-Undrained (CU) tests across the selected sections for analyses.

To ascertain the permanent stability of the seawalls, 2D finite element analyses were performed for a series of sections along the perimeter seawalls of the island. Review of the obtained the VST and CPTs were carried out to derive soil strata after settlement and determine strength profiles for zones subjected to different stress levels and loading histories. **Figure \ref{f_2d_model}** shows one of sections selected for stability evaluation, and **Figure \ref{f_2d_failure}** shows the failure surface identified by a strength reduction method. For a comprehensive assessment, we also collected the monitoring data from the site to verify the output of the model, such as reviewing the VWP monitoring data and performed a sense check of the strength adopted. A more detailed illustration of the analysis is presented in **Appendix C5**.

![Failure Surface Captured by the Strength Reduction Method\label{f_2d_failure}](Image/2D Failure Surface.png){width=400}

### Construction Supervision of Rubble Mound Seawall

I was responsible for supervision of construction of rubble mound seawalls near Portion D at the site. Site photos of the seawalls are shown in **Figure \ref{f_seawall}**, and one checking record showing the progress of the construction is shown in **Figure \ref{f_programme}**.

![Construction of Seawall\label{f_seawall}](Image/Seawall construction A.jpg){width=500}

![Monitoring the Progress of Contruction\label{f_programme}](Image/Seawall Progress.png){width=600}

I closely monitored the actual progress of the works and I had the inspectors of works to report daily the quantities of material deposited. The tonnage collected was then used as key indicators for monitoring the seawall construction progress and forecast the date of completion.  Once the potential delay is anticipated based on the assessment, I arranged meetings with the contractor to understand their difficulties.
Rubble mound seawalls are composed of a various layer of rock with the different requirement of thickness and Particle Size Distribution. I also performed the checking of the levels and sample of rockfills to ensure that the specification in the contract is correctly followed. As this Portion is closest to the Hong Kong International Airport, I also performed regular checks to ensure the airport height restriction is fully complied with during the construction and the operator of the machine and the supervisory stall on board were aware of the height limit and signed the form acknowledging the height restriction before starting his work.

### Safety and Environment Matters

I joined weekly and monthly site safety walks (**Appendix \ref{a_BCF_safety}**) to inspect the actual implementation of the Safety Plan on site and attended the Site Safety and Environment Committee meetings afterwards. I discussed with the site agent/safety supervisors on deficiencies identified during the safety walk and closely followed up their actions until the items are rectified. During the site inspections, I also checked welfare facilities provided to the workers, which could include shelters, sanitary facilities, drinking water, etc.

I also worked part-time in the environment team. My duties included verifying and auditing the effective implementation of environmental mitigation measures stipulated in the Environmental Permit and the Environmental Monitoring and Audit Manual. I worked closely with the Environmental Team (ET) and the Independent Environmental Checker (IEC) to ensure contractor’s full compliance with relevant ordinances and regulations. I joined weekly Environmental walks to check the implementation status of the environmental protective measures of the contractor and inspected the conditions of the site against the environmental checklist. Deficiencies observed at the site could be excessive emission of dark smoke, unauthorised discharge to the sea, insufficient dust suppression measures, disconnected silt curtain etc.

I also reviewed the submitted records from the contractor to check the compliance with the Particular Specification requirements, for example, the environment toolbox training records and environment induction records. To minimise the disturbance to the Chinese White Dolphins (**Appendix \ref{a_BCF_env}**)  and avoid collision of marine traffic near the construction site, a marine traffic route plan was implemented where route and speed of vessels within the area are subject to the prescribed limit. I joined periodic audits to ensure no breach of the regulations set out in the Marine Travel Route Plan.

### Contractual Involvement  

During the execution of this project, I prepared a number of variation orders(VO) concerning instrumentation and strength verification. I  worked in close collaboration with the quantity survey team and the contractor to establish the cost of VOs.  Once works are completed, I also verified the as-constructed quantities and pricing from the contractor on the related works were supported with a valid basis. At the end of the project, I was also involved in claim assessments regarding various aspects of the project and had accumulated valuable experience and knowledge of project management and contract administration of the large-scale project.

## Hong Kong Offshore LNG Terminal Project (07/2019 ~ Present)

To support the increasing use of natural gas in Hong Kong from 2020 onwards, Castle Peak Power Company Limited, The Hong Kong Electric Company, Limited, together with Hong Kong LNG Terminal Limited, are collectively developing an offshore Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project in Hong Kong. The Project involves the engineering, procurement, construction and operation of the proposed offshore LNG receiving facility located in the southern waters of Hong Kong, to the east of the Soko Islands, and the associated pipelines.

The receiving facility will use the Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU) technology as a viable additional gas supply option. An FRSU vessel, which will moor at the Offshore LNG Jetty (Jetty), will provide facilities to regasify LNG delivered by an LNG Carrier (LNGC), so that natural gas can be supplied to the Gas Receiving Station (GRS) at Black Point Power Station (BPPS) via an approximately 45km subsea pipeline (BPPS Pipeline). While, the supply of natural gas to the GRS at the Lamma Power Station (LPS), owned and operated by HK Electric, will be via a separate 18km subsea pipeline (LPS Pipeline). The entire project comprises three packages, an offshore jetty consisting of 6 mooring dophins and 3 breasting dolphins (Package A) (see **Appendix \ref{a_HKOLNGT_Dolphin_layout}**)and two segment pipelines connecting to BPPS and LPS respectively (Package B and Package C).

Arup has been commissioned by the EPC contractor Offshore Oil Engineering Co. Ltd (COOEC) to provide technical engineering consultancy services in the fields of  geotechnical, marine, fire-fighting etc. I have been heavily involved in the project since July 2019 working as the lead project engineer from validation of Front End Engineering (FEED) at tender stage to the EPC detailed design stage. 

Considering the scale of the project, it has been divided into three packages covering the jetty, BPPS Pipeline and LPS Pipeline as shown in **Figure \ref{f_LNG_layout}**.

![General Layout of the HKOLNGT Project \label{f_LNG_layout}](Image/HKOLGNT_Jetty_Layout.png){width=600}

### Project Management and Works Coordination

The development of the offshore LNT Terminal and associated pipelines is multidisciplinary in nature and requires collaboration from various disciplines, including geotechnical, structural, pipeline, marine, fire and safety,etc. 

Being the lead project engineer starting from the Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) validation in the mid of 2019 to the present detailed design, I have been managing the communication and interfacing with different disciplines of Contractor. I discuss the work progress, negotiate and agree with the Contractor on the deliverables, set dates of completion, sort out priorities of the requests, review the scope of works and propose additional fees if requests from Contractor is considered additional. 

Internally, I assign works to propriate engineers, set target deliverable dates, constantly review resources and hold regular meetings with teams to monitor the progress, identify critical issues and propose resolutions. 

### Statutory Approval

Arup is also responsible for obtaining statuary approval of the project, mostly from Buildings Department.  Offshore Jackets are customarily designed to International Codes,for example, American Petroleum Institute (API) Codes, which are less familiar to the engineers in Government Departments. It is required that the design checks be made based on Hong Kong local Codes (mostly applicable to onshore structures) to demonstrate that designs are adequate and in line with common local engineering practice. The project is the first of its kind in Hong Kong and has been receiving considerable attention since the very beginning as it is first of the kind in Hong Kong. I have been working closely with the Contractor and its supporting subconsultant to provide justifications and clarification in the process of design approval. 

# CONCLUSION

Having been a practitioner and researcher in civil engineering around 11 years, I have acquired invaluable professional design and construction experience as well as project management, communication and interpersonal skills. I have developed abilities to make independent engineering judgment and gained confidence in resolving problems encountered in civil engineering projects. I am confident that I have achieved the professional standards to work as a professional engineer and have the capability to take up more challenges and responsibilities in the engineering industry.
